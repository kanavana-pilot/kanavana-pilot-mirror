+# Contributing to Kanavana Pilot Mirror
+
+This repository is a **sanitized mirror** of the Kanavana pilot environment.  
+It is intended for demonstration and collaboration purposes in EU project applications.
+
+## Guidelines
+
+1. **No secrets in this repo**  
+   - `.env` and `.htaccess` are ignored.  
+   - Use `.env.example` and `.htaccess.sample` to document variables/config.  
+
+2. **Patch workflow**  
+   - Clone or fork the repository.  
+   - Make changes locally.  
+   - Create a unified diff:
+     ```bash
+     git diff > patch-xyz.diff
+     ```
+   - Share the patch file for review.  
+
+3. **Applying patches**  
+   - On the mirror maintainer side:
+     ```bash
+     git apply patch-xyz.diff
+     git commit -am "apply: patch xyz"
+     git push
+     ```
+
+4. **Style & documentation**  
+   - Each prototype file should include a header comment (already added).  
+   - README.md provides project overview.  
+   - Keep commits atomic with clear messages.  
+
+## Purpose
+This mirror is not a production repo but a safe place to show structure, receive improvements, and track clean history for the Kanavana Pilot project.
